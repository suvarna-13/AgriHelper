# AgriHelper
This project is a web application for farmers. It works as a help assistant in farming. It has some great functionalities that will assist farmers to be more productive. It will provide a simple user-efficient web platform where farmers can ask queries related to farming and anyone who knows the solution can respond to these queries. It also assists farmers to use the best fertilizers based on the soil and crop data provided by the farmer. We will provide enough data on how and where they can do the soil testing as there are many government laboratories who do these soil testing. Farmers can also predict crops based on their soil type and nutrients present in the soil. They can check their plant health in case of abnormal growth of the plants. On this platform, we are also going to provide the best learning resources for farmers to be more productive. These learning resources include online videos.
